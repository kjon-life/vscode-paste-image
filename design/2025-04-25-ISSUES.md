## Issue 1: Update Dependencies to Resolve npm Warnings (COMPLETED)

**Title:** Update Dependencies to Resolve npm Warnings

During npm install, several warnings are generated about deprecated packages. We need to update these dependencies to their modern replacements.

### Warnings:

1. `inflight@1.0.6`: Leaks memory
   - [x] Replace with an alternative or update to a newer version that doesn't have memory leaks
   - [x] Added to resolutions in package.json: `npm:lru-cache@^10.0.0`

2. `@humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0` and `@humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3`
   - [x] Replace with `@eslint/config-array` and `@eslint/object-schema`
   - [x] Removed these dependencies as they were unnecessary

3. `rimraf@3.0.2`
   - [x] Update to v4 or newer
   - [x] Added to resolutions in package.json: `^4.0.0`

4. `glob@7.2.3`
   - [x] Update to v9 or newer
   - [x] Removed direct dependency
   - [x] Added to resolutions in package.json: `^9.0.0`

5. `eslint@8.57.1`
   - [x] Update to the latest supported version
   - [x] Updated to v9.0.0

6. `lodash.get@4.4.2`

   - [x] Added to resolutions: `npm:just-safe-get@^4.0.0`

7. `boolean@3.2.0`
   - [x] Find alternative or evaluate if it's still needed
   - [x] Added to resolutions: `npm:is-boolean-object@^2.0.0`

8. `vsce@2.15.0`
   - [x] Replace with `@vscode/vsce`

9. `@types/electron@1.6.12`
   - [x] Remove as Electron provides its own type definitions

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] All npm warnings are resolved
- [x] Functionality is not broken by the updates
- [x] Tests pass with the updated dependencies

**Labels:** dependencies, maintenance

## Issue 2: Replace vsce with @vscode/vsce (COMPLETED)

**Title:** Replace vsce with @vscode/vsce

**Description:**
The `vsce` package has been deprecated and renamed to `@vscode/vsce`. We need to update our build scripts and dependencies to use the new package.

### Tasks:
- [x] Update package.json to replace vsce with @vscode/vsce
- [x] Update any build scripts that reference vsce
- [x] Verify that packaging the extension still works correctly

## Issue 5: Remove Unnecessary @types/electron Dependency (COMPLETED)

**Description:**
The `@types/electron` package is a stub types definition that's no longer needed as Electron provides its own type definitions. We should remove this dependency.
